## Overview

This project implements a raycasting engine that creates a pseudo-3D environment from a 2D map. The renderer casts rays from the player's perspective to determine wall distances and heights, creating the illusion of three-dimensional space. The game features textured walls, floor rendering, audio effects, and multiple playable levels.

## Features

### Core Rendering
- Raycasting algorithm for real-time 3D visualization
- Dynamic texture mapping on walls
- Floor and ceiling rendering
- Adjustable field of view and rendering distance

### Gameplay Elements
- First-person perspective navigation
- Multiple map levels with different layouts
- Interactive doors and obstacles
- Flashlight mechanic with audio feedback
- Player UI overlay

### Technical Features
- Frame rate limiting (144 FPS target)
- SDL2-based graphics and audio
- CMake build system
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Efficient texture loading and caching

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before building the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **C++ Compiler** (GCC 9+ or Clang 10+ with C++20 support)
- **CMake** (version 3.22 or higher)
- **SDL2** development libraries
- **SDL2_image** development libraries

#### Installing Dependencies on Linux

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install gcc-c++ cmake SDL2-devel SDL2_image-devel

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake sdl2 sdl2_image

# NixOS
# Use the provided shell.nix file for a reproducible development environment
nix-shell

# Or install system-wide
nix-env -iA nixos.cmake nixos.SDL2 nixos.SDL2_image nixos.gcc
```

#### Installing Dependencies on macOS

```bash
brew install cmake sdl2 sdl2_image
```

#### Installing Dependencies on Windows

Download the development libraries from:
- SDL2: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases
- SDL2_image: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/releases


### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mooofin/HEKATE.git
cd HEKATE
```


### Building the Project

#### Linux/macOS

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

#### NixOS

The project includes a `shell.nix` file for a reproducible build environment:

```bash
# Enter the Nix shell environment
nix-shell

# Then build as usual
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

#### Windows

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```


### Running the Game

After building, run the executable from the build directory:

```bash
./doom
```

Make sure you run the game from the `build` directory so that asset paths are correctly resolved.

### Key Components

**main.cpp**
- Game initialization and main loop
- Event handling and input processing
- Frame rate management
- Audio playback system

**raycaster.h**
- Ray casting algorithm implementation
- Wall collision detection
- Distance calculations and rendering
- Texture coordinate mapping

**imageloader.h**
- SDL2 image loading wrapper
- Texture caching system
- Rendering utilities

**color.h**
- RGB color structures
- Color manipulation utilities


## Technical Implementation

### Raycasting Algorithm

The raycasting engine works by:

1. Casting rays from the player position at angles across the field of view
2. Calculating intersection points with the map grid
3. Determining the distance to walls using the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm
4. Projecting wall heights based on distance (perspective correction)
5. Mapping textures onto walls based on hit positions

### Performance Optimizations

- Frame rate capping at 144 FPS to prevent excessive CPU usage
- Efficient map representation using 2D character arrays
- Texture caching to minimize file I/O
- Optimized ray stepping algorithms
